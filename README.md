# Overview
Basic To-Do List created using SASS &amp; JavaScript for the purpose of building on JavaScript skills.

## Description
The goal of this task was to understand some new concepts and to develop a stronger understanding of the DOM and JavaScript.

### What I learned about JavaScript
I learned some new useful concepts while creating this project.
* for...of loops
* Timeout statements
* if & else statements
* Event listeners
* DOM methods
* Debugging

### Things that can be improved
I would have loved to add a delete button to each list item, as well as a mark completed button. However, I'd like to move on from this project as I've learnt what I set out to learn. I plan to do more passive learning from now on, as there's only so much you can learn from getting hands-on. The design on this project was something I wasn't fussed about at all, so just created a rough design in about an hour, as design is not something that I'd like to focus on when solely learning JavaScript.
